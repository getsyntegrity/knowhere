# Rationale: LLMs such as deepseek-chat have a strong prior toward Chinese when
# summarizing numeric / structured input (financial tables, GAAP terms, etc.),
# and a soft "same language as the input" instruction is often ignored. We
# therefore detect the input language deterministically at the caller site and
# inject an EXPLICIT "Respond ONLY in <lang>" directive into the prompt.

# Callers pass ``paras['lang']`` with one of: 'en', 'zh', or None. When None,

    #         context (they tell you how many body lines sit between two adjacent heading
    #         candidates).
    #         - You MUST NOT emit placeholder rows in your output.
    #         - The output id field MUST be a single integer; never return an id containing
    #           a hyphen ("-") or the level placeholder "-".
    #         - Only evaluate rows whose id is a single integer.
    #
    #         ***Process in THREE steps:***
    #
    #         **STEP 1 — Global Pattern Scan (before assigning any levels)**
    #         Scan ALL candidate heading rows across the entire input.
    #         Identify every distinct structural/numbering pattern that signals hierarchy depth, for example:
    #         - Decimal numbering: "1", "1.1", "1.1.1" → depth increases with dot count
    #         - Enumeration styles such as Chinese numerals, numbered bullets,
    #           or circled digits map from shallower to deeper levels
    #         - Chapter/section keywords: "Chapter X", "Part X", and Chinese
    #           chapter/section markers
    #         - Indentation or formatting cues visible in the text prefix
    #         Rank these patterns from shallowest to deepest to form a pattern → level mapping.
    #
    #         **STEP 2 — Assign levels using the following rules (in priority order)**
    #         Rows marked as "Not Sure" should be treated like any other candidate row:
    #         use the same rules below to decide whether they are true headings (level >= 1)
    #         or body text (level = -1).
    #
    #         Rule 0 — Figure/Image rows are always body text (highest priority, no exceptions):
    #             Any row whose heading text is exactly "Figure/Image" MUST be assigned level = -1.
    #             These represent embedded images, figures, or inline resource references in the document.
    #             Do NOT include these rows in the output (they are automatically treated as level = -1).
    #         Rule 1 — Normalize to start at level 1:
    #             The shallowest heading pattern found in this document MUST be assigned level 1.
    #             Do NOT preserve preliminary estimates that start at level 2, 3, or deeper
    #             if those headings are actually the top-level headings of the document.
    #         Rule 2 — Global consistency (highest priority among content rules):
    #             Headings that share the same structural pattern SHOULD receive the SAME level
    #             throughout the ENTIRE document, regardless of their position or textual content.
    #             (e.g., all "X.Y" two-part numbers must have the same level; all "X.Y.Z"
    #             three-part numbers must share a different, deeper level.)
    #         Rule 3 — Pattern over semantics:
    #             When determining a heading's level, its numbering/structural pattern takes
    #             precedence over its text length or semantic meaning.
    #             Parenthetical annotations or long descriptions inside a heading text do NOT
    #             indicate a different hierarchy level.
    #         Rule 4 — Parent-child continuity and no level skipping:
    #             Each heading must be consistent with adjacent headings.
    #             A heading may stay at the same level, return to an ancestor level,
    #             or go only ONE level deeper than its nearest valid ancestor heading.
    #             Level jumps such as level 1 directly to level 3 are invalid.
    #         Rule 5 — Body text demotion:
    #             If a row does not truly serve as a section title in the document outline,
    #             set its level to -1.
    #             Strong body-text cues include:
    #             - a full sentence or clause ending with sentence punctuation
    #             - an isolated broken word, broken phrase, label fragment, data value, or body continuation
    #             - a single Chinese character, digit, or very short fragment that clearly combines
    #               with the next row to form one continuous phrase rather than a standalone heading
    #         Rule 6 — Semantic heading promotion:
    #             A row with NO obvious numbering or structural-format markers can still
    #             be a heading, but ONLY when ALL of the following conditions are met:
    #             (a) The text is short and title-like (not a full sentence with punctuation).
    #             (b) It is NOT a broken fragment that simply continues into the next row
    #                 (those belong to Rule 5 body-text demotion).
    #             (c) Multiple longer body-text rows follow it, and the row clearly
    #                 organizes, summarizes, or introduces the topic of those rows —
    #                 i.e., removing it would leave the following rows without a
    #                 meaningful section label.
    #             Being short alone is NOT sufficient; the row must demonstrably serve
    #             as a section boundary that groups the content below it.
    #             When promoting, assign a level consistent with the surrounding
    #             hierarchy — typically one level deeper than the nearest heading above.
    #
    #         **STEP 3 — Consistency check (one pass) before writing output**
    #         Scan the level assignments you are about to output and confirm:
    #         - All headings sharing the same structural or semantic pattern have been assigned the same level.
    #         If any inconsistency is found, normalise to the most representative level for that pattern.
    #
    #         ***Output requirements***
    #         - Output must be a [JSON array] only
    #         - **Only include rows that you judge to be headings** (level >= 1). Do NOT include body text rows (level = -1) in the output
    #         - Any row not present in your output will be automatically treated as body text (level = -1)

        2) PLACEHOLDER — ``id`` is ALWAYS a hyphenated range "start-end" (for a
           single-line it is "N-N", e.g. "56-56"); ``heading`` is "[N BODY LINES]"

        ***Process in THREE steps:***

        **STEP 1 — Global Pattern Scan (CANDIDATES ONLY)**
        Enumerate every distinct numbering / structural / semantic granularity pattern that

        - Chapter/section keywords: "Chapter X", "Part X", "第X章", "第X节"
        - Upper case / lower case differences in candidate headings
        - Clear semantic granularities or groups of themes
        Rank these patterns from shallowest to deepest to form a pattern → level mapping.
        Placeholder rows MUST NOT influence this scan.

        **STEP 2 — Assign a level to every candidate (rules in priority order)**
        A candidate whose preliminary ``level`` is "Not Sure" or any positive
        integer is **always** open to revision. Pure body text has already been
        folded into placeholders, but a candidate that slipped through the
        pre-filter **can still be** demoted to level = -1.

        Rule 0 — Global consistency (highest priority among all rules):
            Candidates sharing the same structural pattern or semantic granularity MUST receive the
            SAME level across the ENTIRE input. (e.g. every "X.Y" pattern
            shares one level; every "X.Y.Z" shares a different, deeper level.)

        Rule 1 — Parent-child continuity and no level skipping:
            A heading, compared to candidates before it, may stay at the same level, 
            or go ONE level deeper than its nearest valid ancestor heading.
            However, jumps such as level 1 → level 3 are **always invalid**.

        Rule 2 — Semantic headings detection (NO numbering pattern):
            A candidate WITHOUT any structural/numbering marker can still be a
            heading, but ONLY when ALL of the following hold:
            a) The text is short and title-like — no sentence-ending punctuation.
            b) It is NOT a broken fragment that continues into the next row
            c) In the input sequence it is IMMEDIATELY followed by a
                placeholder ``[N BODY LINES]``, or by another candidate with finer granularity.
                This is the "section bulk" signal — the row introduces a body block or a subsection group.
            When Rule-2 is satisfied, pick a level consistent with Rule 1

        Rule 3 — Body text demotion (candidate → -1):
            Demote a candidate to level = -1 when it clearly does NOT serve as a section title. 
            In compact input, the strongest demotion cues are:
            - Two CANDIDATE rows appear adjacent with NO placeholder between them
            - The text contains equations and math symbols such as + = - × ÷.
            - The text is exactly "Figure/Image", demote it to level = -1.
            - The text is an isolated broken phrase, fragment, data value, or caption-like snippet (e.g. "Table 3-2", "Figure 4"

        Rule 4 — Normalise to start at level 1:
            The shallowest (the most coarse granularity) heading found MUST be assigned level 1.

        **STEP 3 — Consistency check (one pass) before writing output**
        Re-scan the level assignments you are about to emit:
        - All headings sharing the same pattern (structural or semantic granularity) must share the same level.
        - No invalid skips (Rule 1).
        If any inconsistency is found, normalise to the most representative level for that pattern.

        ***Output requirements***
        - Output MUST be a [JSON array] only.
        - Include ONLY candidate rows you judge to be headings (level >= 1).
        - NEVER emit a placeholder row. Every ``id`` field MUST be a single integer (no hyphen).
        - Each element must contain these fields in order:
            - "id": original line number (integer)
            - "level": the corrected heading level (integer from 1 to {max_depth})

        ***Format requirements***
        - Output only valid JSON — do not add markdown fences (no ```json).
        - Do not add any explanations, comments, control characters, or descriptive texts.

        You are a document structure auditing expert specializing in Table of Contents (TOC) analysis. You will receive a Markdown table representing a TOC extracted from a document. Each row is a TOC entry, including:
        1. id column: line number (integer)

        ***Critical Context***:
        This is a Table of Contents (TOC), NOT body text. In a TOC:
        - ALL rows are heading entries pointing to document sections
        - There is NO body text in a TOC - every line represents a chapter, section, or subsection title
        - Level -1 (body text marker) is NOT applicable in TOC context

        ***Your Task***:
        Analyze the hierarchical structure of this TOC and assign the correct level (1 to {max_depth}) to each entry.

        ***Hierarchy Rules***:
        1. Top-level chapters (e.g., "Chapter 1", "Part I", "一、", "第一章", Roman numerals like "I.", "II.") should be level 1
        2. Numbered items under a chapter (e.g., "1.", "2.", "1.1", "(1)") are typically level 2 or deeper
        3. Sub-items with deeper numbering (e.g., "1.1.1", "(a)", "①") indicate level 3 or deeper
        4. Levels between consecutive entries cannot skip (e.g., jumping from level 1 to level 3 is invalid)
        5. When entries share the same numbering pattern, they should have the same level
        
        ***Output Requirements***:
        - Output MUST be a JSON array only
        - Each element must contain exactly these fields in order:
            - "id": original line number (integer)
            - "level": the corrected level for that entry (integer from 1 to {max_depth})
        - DO NOT use level -1 (this is a TOC, not body text)
        - If uncertain about a level, estimate based on the numbering pattern and context

        ***Format Requirements***:
        - Output only valid JSON, no markdown code fences (no ```json)
        - No escaped newlines or control characters
